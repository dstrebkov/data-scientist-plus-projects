# Analysis of bank's borrower reliability


## Data

Table with bank customer data of the following columns:

- `children` — number of children in the family;
- `days_employed` — total work experience in days;
- `dob_years` — client's age in years;
- `education` — client's education level;
- `education_id` — educational level identifier (ID);
- `family_status` — family status;
- `family_status_id` — family status identifier (ID);
- `gender` — client's gender;
- `income_type` — type of employment;
- `debt` — if a client has any loan repayment arrears or not;
- `total_income` — monthly income;
- `purpose` — purpose of the loan.

## Task

It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank — statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model — a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to a bank.
