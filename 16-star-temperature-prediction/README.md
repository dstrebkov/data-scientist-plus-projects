# Star temperature prediction

## Data

Dataset features are the following:

- `Temperature (K)` — temperature at the surface of a star in Kelvin(target feature);
- `Luminosity(L/Lo)` — star's luminosity relative to the Sun;
- `Radius(R/Ro)` — radius of a star relative to the radius of the Sun;
- `Absolute magnitude(Mv)` — physical quantity that characterizes the brilliance of a star;
- `Star type` — type of a star; 
- `Star color` — color of a star.

## Task

Having characteristics of `240` cosmic stars already studied, create a neural network to determine the temperature on the surface of the discovered stars.

## Used Tools & Libraries
`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `pytorch`
