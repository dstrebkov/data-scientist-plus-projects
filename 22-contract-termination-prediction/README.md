## Task

Some telecom operator wants to deal with the outflow of customers. To do this, its employees will begin to offer promotional codes and special conditions to everyone who plans to refuse communication services. In order to find such users in advance, the operator needs a model that will predict whether the subscriber will terminate the contract. The operator's team collected personal data about some customers, information about their tariffs and services. So, the task is to train a model for predicting customer churn on this data.

The ROC-AUC metric value must be at least `0.85`. For model interpretability, additionally display the accuracy value.
